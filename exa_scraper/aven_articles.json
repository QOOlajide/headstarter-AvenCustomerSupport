If you have opted only to pay interest during the draw period, you may be shocked at the new, higher monthly payments of interest and principal that are now required, and you may wonder, can a HELOC be refinanced? It is possible to refinance a HELOC. If you are thinking about it, you have a few options to choose from, and you may be able to keep your HELOC.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThere are a few ways that a HELOC can be refinanced and payments decreased. Your options are to request a loan modification to your current HELOC, get a new HELOC, refinance your HELOC and mortgage into a new first mortgage, or get a home equity loan to pay off your HELOC.\nYou may want to refinance your HELOC if you're having a hard time making the monthly payments and want better loan terms. Refinancing could also help you lock in a low fixed interest rate. Another reason to refinance is that you may need more time and funds to make further home improvements.\nEach refinance option comes with its own set of pros and cons. Carefully consider each option and your situation before deciding which alternative suits your needs the best.\n\nReasons to Refinance a HELOC\n\nA HELOC is a type of revolving credit line backed by the equity you have in your home, which means your property is used as collateral and secures the line of credit. HELOCs are divided into two phases: the draw period, during which you can borrow money from the credit line, repay, and borrow again, and the repayment period, during which you pay back any outstanding balance.\n\nDuring the draw period of your HELOC you are only required to pay interest on what you borrow. During the repayment period you can no longer withdraw funds, and you have to make monthly payments of principal and interest. If you've opted to pay only the interest during the draw period, you may be shocked at the increased monthly payments once you reach the repayment phase. Refinancing your HELOC may help make payments more affordable and could also allow you to take advantage of interest rates trending lower.\n\nAnother reason to refinance is that you may need more time and funds to make further home improvements. If your home's value has increased, you may be able to get more money from your home equity to complete the additional projects.\n\nWays to Refinance a HELOC\n\nThere are a few ways to refinance your HELOC. Consider your situation and your reason for refinancing, and make sure to check your options with several lenders before settling on a solution.\n\nAPPLY FOR A LOAN MODIFICATION\n\nThe first option when you're having difficulties making payments is to request a loan modification. Your lender may lower the interest rate or increase the repayment term to make your monthly payments more affordable and help you avoid defaulting.\n\nTo get your loan modification request approved, you will have to prove to your lender that you will be able to make payments under the new, negotiated terms. Keep in mind that not all lenders offer loan modifications.\n\nGET A NEW HELOC\n\nIf you want to buy time before entering the repayment phase, you may choose to open a new HELOC. This allows you to extend the draw period and its interest-only payment requirement and avoid principal payments for a while longer. This option may also be good if your home value has increased and you want to make a few more adjustments or improvements to your home and need more time and funds to do so.\n\nGetting a new HELOC and draw period may tempt you to borrow more, so make sure not to borrow beyond your means. Remember that you will eventually need to pay back your loan, and the longer you put it off, the higher your interest and your monthly payments will be. Also, keep in mind that because HELOC rates are adjustable, they may keep going up.\n\nREFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE AND HELOC TOGETHER\n\nAnother option is to refinance your mortgage and HELOC together into a new first mortgage. This way, you may be able to secure a significantly lower interest rate. First mortgage rates are generally lower than both HELOC rates and home equity loan rates, as the first mortgage lender is first in line to profit if you were to default on payments and your house was to get foreclosed on.\n\nA new first mortgage usually has a fixed interest rate, making your monthly payments more predictable and plannable, but keep in mind that closing costs may be high.\n\nGET A HOME EQUITY LOAN TO PAY OFF YOUR HELOC\n\nYour fourth option is to get a home equity loan, also called a second mortgage, to pay off your HELOC. Since a home equity loan is paid out in a lump sum, you can use it to pay off your HELOC, and you won't be tempted to keep borrowing, as can happen with a revolving credit line. You will also get the stability of a fixed interest rate and steady monthly payments that don't change. The downside can be closing costs and fees and the fact that a long, drawn-out payment period can increase the total interest you will have to pay.\n\nAre you considering getting a HELOC? Aven can get you approved in as fast as 15 minutes.

As with all loans, this type of transaction isn\u2019t free and it\u2019s important to shop around for a competitive interest rate. But you may be wondering: Are HELOC rates fixed or variable? Well, they can be both. Let us explain.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe interest rate on a HELOC is generally variable, which means it moves up and down in accordance with the benchmark rate it is tied to.\nThe prime rate is the most commonly used benchmark rate for HELOCs. The prime rate is largely based on the federal funds rate, which is set by members of the Federal Reserve.\nSome lenders may provide an option to convert a variable rate to a fixed rate, which can help you budget and keep monthly payments stable for an agreed-upon term.\nConverting your HELOC to a fixed rate may come with fees or minimum withdrawal requirements, so check the conditions with your lender before deciding whether or not to convert.\n\nVariable-Rate HELOCs\n\nThe interest rate on a traditional HELOC is usually variable, meaning it won't necessarily be the same every month. To understand how and why HELOC rates vary, we first need to understand how the index rate works.\n\nVariable interest rates are tied to an index, or benchmark, rate and increase or decrease based on moves in that rate. The index most commonly used for HELOCs is the prime rate, which the big banks charge their most creditworthy clients, who are generally large corporations. The prime rate changes over time because it is based primarily on the federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC meets eight times a year to decide whether to raise or lower the federal funds rate based on current economic conditions. When the FOMC decides to change its rate, it affects the prime rate and, in turn, your HELOC rate.\n\nIn addition to the prime rate, the lender adds a markup based on your credit score, combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) and payment history. Generally, the lower your CLTV ratio and higher your credit score, the better your rate will be.\n\nWhen shopping around for a HELOC, you may see offers like \"prime+0%\" or \"prime-1%\". These are introductory or limited-time offers, so your rate will go up after a predetermined amount of time. Also keep in mind that, even if your lender offers you a low initial rate, the FOMC could increase the prime rate several times in a row, leading to an increase in your HELOC rate.\n\nFixed-Rate Option\n\nSome lenders offer the option to convert all or part of your loan to a fixed interest rate, which means that your rate will stay the same for a determined term, no matter what direction the prime rate and federal funds rate moves. With a fixed rate, you can stabilize your monthly payments and avoid any uncertainty. Converting your HELOC can usually be done at closing or any time during the draw period.\n\nThe fixed-rate term could last anywhere from one to 30 years, depending on the lender. Some lenders only offer limited terms, or may require minimum withdrawals. You could also be asked to pay a small fee to convert your variable-rate HELOC to a fixed interest rate. The longer it takes to pay off your debt, the more interest you will pay in the long run.\n\nIt may be worth it to convert a variable-rate HELOC to a fixed rate if you think the prime rate will increase, or want more control over your monthly payments. However, if you choose to convert and the prime rate falls, you lose out on a lower rate. Ultimately, the decision depends on your personal situation and how comfortable you are with current economic conditions.\n\nAre you considering a HELOC, but worried about the variable interest rate rising? With the Aven HELOC Card, your rate will never exceed 18%, no matter how high the prime rate goes. Read about it here and decide if it's right for you!\n\nAVEN\n\nCard\n\nHow It Works\n\nTestimonials\n\nApp\n\nAbout Us\n\nCareers\n\nRESOURCES\n\nPress\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms of Service\n\nPay It Forward\n\nLicenses\n\nDisclosures\n\n\u00a9 2025 Aven\n\nThe annual percentage rate (\u201cAPR\u201d) is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and does not include costs other than interest.

Keep reading to learn how HELOCs on rental properties work, how to get one and what it can be used for.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIt is possible to open a HELOC on a rental property, just like you can on your primary residence.\nHowever, not all lenders offer HELOCs on investment properties because, in the event of financial hardship, the owner is more likely to prioritize their primary home over a rental property.\nAs a result, qualifying for a HELOC on an investment property may be more challenging and requires a higher credit score than for a HELOC on your primary residence.\n\nHow Do HELOCs Work?\n\nA HELOC allows you to tap into the equity you\u2019ve acquired in your home to help pay for home improvements and renovations. Mathematically, the amount is the current market value of the property minus the outstanding balance on the primary mortgage. A HELOC carries less risk for lenders than other types of loans because the home is used as collateral in the case of a default and, therefore, comes with competitive interest rates for the borrower.\n\nA HELOC is made up of two phases: A draw period that typically lasts five to 10 years and a repayment period that lasts between 10 and 20 years. During the draw period, you can use the line of credit to borrow cash, repay it, and borrow more, much like an ordinary credit card. You only have to pay back what you spend, plus interest. During the repayment phase, you can no longer withdraw funds and start paying down debt in the form of monthly principal and interest payments. To learn more about how HELOCs work, take a look at this article.\n\nIf you're a real estate investor, you may be wondering if it's possible to take out a HELOC on a rental property. The short answer is yes. However, there's a lot to consider before applying.\n\nHELOCs on an Investment Property\n\nA HELOC on an investment property functions in the exact same way as a HELOC on a personal property, but the process of acquiring one can prove much more challenging due to the increased risk for the lender.\n\nFINDING A LENDER\n\nNot all lenders offer HELOCs on rental properties because the risk of default is much higher than with personal properties. In the event of a financial hardship, the borrower is much more likely to prioritize paying the loan on their primary property before paying down debt on a secondary property, whether that\u2019s in the form of a HELOC or mortgage. In the case of a foreclosure, the sale proceeds would first go toward paying off the mortgage before any other liens on the property, such as a HELOC.\n\nThe best way to find a lender that offers investment property HELOCs is to leverage your existing network of real estate investors who have already qualified for a HELOC. Online forums and real estate investing groups may also be helpful.\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR RENTAL PROPERTY HELOCS\n\nDue to the increased risks discussed above, rental property HELOCs are more expensive and come with stricter requirements than for HELOCs on primary residences. The interest rate is typically higher and the borrower must shell out cash for an additional appraisal and title search fees, among other costs.\n\nTo qualify, you\u2019ll need a FICO credit score of 720 or above, versus just 620 for a HELOC on a personal property. The lender will also consider your combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) and debt-to-income ratio (DTI), both of which will need to be low.\n\nUnlike a HELOC on a personal property, lenders oftentimes require the borrower to wait a full year after purchasing the rental property before being eligible for a HELOC so they can prove that they have trustworthy tenants that will make payments on time and provide sufficient cash flow. The lender may also require you to have a large cash reserve on hand that\u2019s equivalent to 18 to 24 months of payments.\n\nWhat Can an Investment Property HELOC be Used For?\n\nA HELOC on an investment property can be used in the exact same way as a HELOC on a personal property. They are most commonly used to pay for renovations and improvements to the property, but can also be used to consolidate high-interest debt, purchase a new property, or anything else you'd like. However, experts advise that HELOCs be used for investments that will grow your wealth over time, rather than for purchases that will not, such as cars or vacation trips.\n\nCurrently Aven\u2019s product is not available for rental or investment properties. Are you considering applying for a HELOC for your primary residence? With Aven's HELOC Card, you can get approved in as fast as 15 minutes and have the card in your hands in a few days.
